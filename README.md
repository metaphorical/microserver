# Microserver

In pursuit for lightest microservice I am doing experiments in few languages and additionally few approaches within them.

At start notes here will be my own quick drops for myself... I hope to extend as myreasearch progresses

## Erlang

It will be super fast.

Rebar3 is tool of choice here so in most of cases:

```
rebar3 compile
rebar3 shell
```

### Basic

Just writing bare server in erlang - http server.

### Psycho

Taking the idea (and a tool) from Garrett Smith, following what he did in his talk on building web server in erlang, logical extension is doing RnD on regular web microservice... Something that gets hit a lot?
