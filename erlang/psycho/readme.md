# Erlang - Psycho boilerplate / framework implementation

This counts as a bare solution since it is based of psycho server that was built by Garret Smith for his own usage and presented in one of his talks. Taking the idea (and a tool) from Garrett S., following what he did in his talk on building web server in erlang, logical extension is doing RnD on regular web microservice...

Turned out I have put a pause on this one due to bad documentation... I can rather write my own routing and go with it then use what is there. At least it looks like it at this moment.

Rebar3 is tool of choice here so in most of cases:

```
$ rebar3 compile
$ rebar3 shell
```
