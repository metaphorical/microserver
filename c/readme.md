# Service built in Kore framework

[Kore, C web framework](https://kore.io/)
[Kore docs](https://docs.kore.io/3.2.0/)

## Running it locally

Kore is installed globally, either by downloading release and make/make installing from site or using brew:

```
brew install kore
```

Kore provides nice cli, **kodev**, that we use to create, build and run. In this case here is how to build (compile), and run it:

```
$ kodev build
$ kodev run
```
